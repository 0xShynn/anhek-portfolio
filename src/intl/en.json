    "title": "About Me",
    "intro": "Hello ! My name is Antonin Nhek. After years of graphics and a period of absence in the communication field, I made a professional reconversion to be web developer in January 2019.",
    "text1": "I started with the bootcamp 'The Hacking Project' where I learned the core concepts of programming and back-end development, algorithmics, pair-programming and peer-learning. I realized various projects in JavaScript, Ruby and Rails. It was also the ideal environment for setting up a daily learning dynamic, developing my communication and teamwork skills.",
    "text2": "Being as much attracted by design as programming, front-end development was naturally the way to go for me. So I continued my self-taught programming journey with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React and Gatsby. I took classes from Udemy, freeCodeCamp, Mosh Hamedani, Wes Bos and others gleaned on the Web.",
    "text3": "In addition to tech field, I'm immersed in the culture Hip-Hop since my teens. I love Spotify, Last.fm, Pinterest and Beyond Meat burgers. I do calisthenics, break-dance, climbing and I like to play Nintendo Switch and card games with my friends.",
    "text4": "I am currently looking for a position as a junior front-end developer. I would love to join a human scale team to bring my skills and my vision.",
