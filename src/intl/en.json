    "intro": "Hello ! My name is Antonin Nhek, I am a Graphic Designer based in Lyon, France. After years of graphics and a period of absence in the communication field, I made a professional reconversion to turn to programming in January 2019.",
    "text1": "I started with the bootcamp 'The Hacking Project' where I learned the core concepts of programming and back-end development, algorithmics, peer-programming and peer-learning. I practiced the Ruby language, used Rails framework and manipulated SQL databases. It was also the ideal environment for setting up a daily learning dynamic, developing my communication and teamwork skills.",
    "text2": "Being as much attracted by design as programming, front-end development was naturally the way to go for me. So I continued my self-taught programming journey with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React and Gatsby. I took classes on Udemy, freeCodeCamp, of Mosh Hamedani, Wes Bos and others gleaned on the Web.",
    "text3": "I did the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter which consisted in publishing your daily development progress. It has opened me to a world wide supportive community. I also participated to Hacktoberfest 2019 which was the first time I contributed to open source projects.",
    "text4": "In addition to the field of tech, I'm immersed in the culture Hip-Hop since my teens, I love Beyond Meat burgers, Last.fm, Pinterest and Spotify. I do calisthenics, break-dance, climbing, I like to play Nintendo Switch and card games with my friends.",
    "text5": "I'm currently looking for an junior front-end developer position. I'd be happy to bring my skills and vision in your team. I'm willing to relocate in Europe.",
