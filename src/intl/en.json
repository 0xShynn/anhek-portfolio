    "intro": "Hello ! My name is Antonin Nhek, Iâ€™m a visual designer based in Lyon, France. After years of doing graphic design and a period away from the communication field, I decided to start a programming journey in January 2019.",
    "text1": "I began with 'The Hacking Project' bootcamp where I learned core programmation concepts, back-end development basics, pair-programming, peer-learning, Ruby, Rails, Git and SQL databases manipulations. It was also the perfect environment to set up a daily learning dynamic, to grow in terms of communication skills and team work.",
    "text2": "As I love design as much as programmation, taking the front-end development path was naturally the right choice for me. So I continued my programming journey as self-taught with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, GraphQL and Gatsby. I took courses from Udemy, freeCodeCamp, Design+Code, Mosh Hamedani, Wes Bos and many others around the web.",
    "text3": "I did the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter which consisted in publishing your daily development progress. It has opened me to a world wide supportive community. I also participated to Hacktoberfest 2019 which was the first time I contributed to open source projects.",
    "text4": "Apart from technology, I'm immersed in Hip-Hop culture since kid, I love Beyond Meat burgers, Last.fm, Pinterest and Spotify. I do calisthenics, break dance, rock climbing and I like playing Switch and cards games with my friends.",
    "text5": "I'm looking for an junior front-end developer position. I'd be happy to bring my skills and vision in your team. I'm willing to relocate in Europe.",
