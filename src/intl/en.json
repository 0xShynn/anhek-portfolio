    "title": "About Me",
    "intro": "Hello ! I am Antonin Nhek. After years of graphics and a period away from the tech industry, I made a professional reconversion in January 2019 to be Web Developer.",
    "text1": "I started with the bootcamp 'The Hacking Project' where I learned the core concepts of programming, back-end development and algorithmics. I realized various projects in JavaScript, Ruby and Rails. It was also the ideal environment for setting up a daily learning dynamic.",
    "text2": "Being as much attracted by design as programming, front-end development was naturally the way to go for me. So I continued my self-taught programming journey with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React and Gatsby. I took courses on websites like Udemy, freeCodeCamp, Mosh Hamedani and Wes Bos.",
    "text3": "In addition to tech field, I'm immersed in Hip-Hop culture since my teens. I regularly practice calisthenics, break-dancing and climbing. I love Spotify, Last.fm, the Nintendo Switch and Beyond Meat burgers :3",
