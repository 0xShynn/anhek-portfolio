# Antonin Nhek : My Portfolio v1

## Description
I'm building a portfolio to showcase my design & front-end development skills. I decided to use the Gatsby framework (based on React) for its architecture and speed performance. I chose the low-level CSS framework tailwincss for its utility-first approach. The website is hosted by Netlify.
